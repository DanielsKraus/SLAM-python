# Below, is the robot class
#
# This robot lives in 2D, x-y space, and its motion is
# pointed in a random direction, initially.
# It moves in a straight line until it comes close to a wall 
# at which point it stops.
#
# For measurements, it  senses the x- and y-distance
# to landmarks. This is different from range and bearing as
# commonly studied in the literature, but this makes it much
# easier to implement the essentials of SLAM without
# cluttered math.
#
